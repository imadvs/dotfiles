Since your setup is now fully automated and professional, you need a **README.md** in your `~/dotfiles` folder. This acts as the "manual" for your system, making it easy for you (or anyone else) to understand how it works.

Here is a clean, professional README tailored to your exact setup:

# 🌌 Imad's Dotfiles

A fully automated Arch Linux environment managed with **GNU Stow**. This repository handles system updates, AUR packages, VS Code extensions, and configuration syncing across machines.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Smart Syncing**: The `up` command automatically links configurations and absorbs new local changes into the repository.
* **VS Code Integration**: Auto-installs extensions and manages `settings.json`.
* **AUR Support**: Integrated `yay` management for Brave Browser and VS Code.
* **Safe Backups**: Automatically creates `.bak` files if conflicts occur.

## 🛠️ Custom Commands

I have created two main aliases to manage this system:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `up` | Performs a full system upgrade, cleans cache, syncs git, and runs `install.sh`. |
| `dots` | Stages all changes, commits with a timestamp, and pushes to GitHub. |

## 📁 Repository Structure

Stow mimics the home directory structure. To add a new config, ensure it follows this pattern:

```text
~/dotfiles/
├── hypr/
│   └── .config/hypr/          # Links to ~/.config/hypr
├── waybar/
│   └── .config/waybar/        # Links to ~/.config/waybar
└── bash/
    └── .bashrc                # Links to ~/.bashrc

```

## 💻 Installation (New Machine)

To restore this environment on a fresh Arch Linux installation:

1. **Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles

```


2. **Run the installer:**
```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

```



## 🔧 Maintenance

If you add a new top-level folder to this repo, update the `FOLDER_MAP` inside `install.sh` to ensure the script knows the correct destination for the symbolic link.

### 🚀 Next Step

To create this file, run:
`nvim ~/dotfiles/README.md`
Paste the text above and save it. Then run `dots` to push your new documentation to GitHub!

**Would you like me to help you add a "System Status" section to the README that shows your hardware specs?**
